Interpreted vs. Compiled Language

Trade-off:

Performance: Compiled languages (C, C++) are generally faster because they are converted directly to
machine code before execution. Interpreted languages (Python, JS) are translated line-by-line during runtime,
which is slower.
Development Speed: Interpreted languages allow for faster testing and debugging (no compile step).
Portability: Interpreted code can run on any machine with the interpreter. Compiled code must be re-compiled
for different operating systems.

Factors for Decision:

Speed requirements: Is it a real-time system? (Choose Compiled).
Development time: Need a quick prototype? (Choose Interpreted).
Target Hardware: Embedded systems with limited resources usually require Compiled languages (C).
