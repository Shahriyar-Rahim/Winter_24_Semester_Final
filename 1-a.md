# Rules for Naming Identifiers in C

### Purpose
**Identifiers** are user-defined names given to variables, functions, arrays, and other entities. They serve to identify these elements uniquely during the execution of a program.

### Core Rules for Identifiers

* **Case Sensitivity:** C is case-sensitive. Uppercase and lowercase letters are not equivalent. 
    * *Example:* `Sum` and `sum` are treated as two different identifiers.
* **Digits:** Digits (0-9) can be included, but an identifier **cannot** start with a digit.
* **Special Characters:** Only the **underscore (_)** is allowed. Other symbols like `@`, `$`, `-`, or spaces are invalid.
* **Keywords:** Reserved words (e.g., `int`, `while`, `const`) cannot be used as identifiers.
* **Length:** Standard ANSI C allows for **31 significant characters**, though modern compilers often support more.

### Validity Analysis

| Identifier | Status | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `amount` | **Valid** | Standard lowercase letters. |
| `addition2value` | **Valid** | Letters and digits (digit is not at the start). |
| `123 45 6789` | **Invalid** | Starts with a digit and contains spaces. |
| `const` | **Invalid** | `const` is a reserved keyword. |
| `'X'` | **Invalid** | Contains quotation marks. |
| `Irecord` | **Valid** | Starts with a letter. |
| `Numl` | **Valid** | Standard alphanumeric. |
| `main` | **Valid** | Technically valid, but not recommended (conflicts with `main` function). |
| `file-3` | **Invalid** | Contains a hyphen (`-`). |
| `Stax` | **Valid** | Standard alphanumeric. |

> **Note:** While identifiers can start with an underscore (`_`), it is generally reserved for system library variables. It is best practice to start your identifiers with a letter.
